By seamlessly integrating visual perception with natural language processing, these advanced models are fundamentally reshaping how machines interpret and analyze complex information across diverse domains. Qwen2.5-VL aims to establish a robust foundation for LVLMs and create an agentic amplifier for real-world applications. The model enhances fine-grained perception capabilities by leveraging the latest Qwen2.5 LLM and employing multi-modal QA data construction.",

      "title": "Core Architecture and Key Innovations of Qwen2.5-VL",
      "context": "The overall model architecture of Qwen2.5-VL consists of three components: Large Language Model, Vision Encoder, and MLP-based Vision-Language Merger. The Vision Encoder employs a redesigned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with 2D-RoPE and window attention. The height and width of the input images are resized to multiples of 28 before being fed into the ViT. The vision encoder processes images by splitting them into patches with a stride of 14, generating a set of image features. To address the efficiency challenges posed by long sequences of image features, we adopt a simple yet effective approach to compress the feature sequences before feeding them into the large language model (LLM). Specifically, instead of directly using the raw patch features extracted by the Vision Transformer (ViT), we first group spatially adjacent sets of four patch features. These grouped features are then concatenated and passed through a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to project them into a dimension that aligns with the text embeddings used in the LLM. The Qwen2.5-VL series adopts large language models as its foundational component. The model is initialized with pre-trained weights from the Qwen2.5 LLM. To better meet the demands of multimodal understanding, we have modified the 1D RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) to our Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding Aligned to Absolute Time.",

      "title": "Native Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Processing: Understanding Space and Time",
      "context": "Qwen2.5-VL introduces advancements in both spatial and temporal dimensions to handle diverse multimodal inputs effectively. In the spatial domain, Qwen2.5-VL dynamically converts images of varying sizes into sequences of tokens with corresponding lengths, using the actual dimensions of the input image to represent bounding boxes, points, and other spatial features. For video inputs, Qwen2.5-VL incorporates dynamic frame rate (FPS) training and absolute time encoding. By adapting to variable frame rates, the model can better capture the temporal dynamics of video content. We introduce a novel and efficient strategy that aligns MRoPE IDs directly with the timestamps, allowing the model to understand the tempo of time through the intervals between temporal dimension IDs.  Building upon the Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (MRoPE) introduced in Qwen2-VL, we extend its capabilities to better handle temporal information in videos. The MRoPE in Qwen2-VL decomposes the position embedding into three distinct components: temporal, height, and width to effectively model multimodal inputs. For videos, Qwen2.5-VL introduces a key improvement: aligning the temporal component of MRoPE with absolute time. As shown in Figure 1, by leveraging the intervals between temporal IDs, the model is able to learn consistent temporal alignment across videos with different FPS sampling rates.",

      "title": "Pre-Training and Post-Training: Data is King",
      "context": "Compared to Qwen2-VL, we have significantly expanded the volume of our pre-training data, increasing it from 1.2 trillion tokens to approximately 4 trillion tokens. Our pre-training dataset encompasses a wide variety of multimodal data, such as image captions, interleaved image-text data, OCR data, visual knowledge, multi-modal academic questions, localization data, document parsing data, video descriptions, video localization, and agent-based interaction data. Throughout the training process, we carefully adjusted the composition and proportions of these data types at different stages to optimize learning outcomes. Interleaved image-text data is essential for multimodal learning, offering three key benefits: (1) enabling in-context learning with simultaneous visual and textual cues (Alayrac et al., 2022), (2) maintaining strong text-only capabilities when images are missing (Lin et al., 2024), and (3) containing a wide range of general information. To improve the generalizability of grounding capabilities, we have developed a comprehensive dataset encompassing bounding boxes and points with referring expressions, leveraging both publicly available datasets and proprietary data. To train Qwen2.5-VL, we synthesized a large corpus of document data, incorporating a diverse array of elements into the documents, such as tables, charts, equations, natural or synthetic images, music sheets, and chemical formulas. The post-training alignment framework of Qwen2.5-VL employs a dual-stage optimization paradigm comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).",
